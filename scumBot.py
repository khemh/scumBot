this implementation reqiures you to pass manually and doesnt check if you can't make a play

you can only play if the cards you are going to play match whats happening on the board
example: if the starting player played a single card, then everyone else can only play single cards
same goes for doubles, triples, straights, and suited straights********to be implemented at a later date

there are special hands called bombs, poisons, and spikes that beat regular plays
bombs: straight of doubles example: 33,44,55
poisons: four of a kind
spikes: consecutive triples :333,444
bombs are the lowest tier of special hands, poisons beat bombs, and spikes beat everything

you can only play your hand if it beats the last hand or ties it

first player to get rid of their cards gets rank of president
second gets vice president
third gets secretary
fourth gets scum
at the beginning of the next round the president can swap 2 cards with scum
vp can swap 1 card with secratary```""")
